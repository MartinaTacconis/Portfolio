            <p>
  Great job for acknowledging how you deal with your anger! Another really important step is to
  identify our triggers. Triggers can be very specific and vary from person to person but here are
  some examples of what can trigger anger. Do any of these trigger your anger?
</p>

<ul class="about-list">
  <li>Situational events such as traffic jams, computer problems, or ringing phones.</li>
  <li>People not doing what you expect them to do.</li>
  <li>People taking advantage of you or lying to you.</li>
  <li>Being blamed, insulted, or made fun of.</li>
  <li>A combination of any of the above.</li>
  <li>I don’t know.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p><em>When user selects any response except "I don't know", chatbot answers...</em></p>
<br>

<p>
  Well done! Now that you have identified your triggers you’re halfway there! Identifying triggers
  can help you stop an anger outburst before it occurs. Here are some ways you could calm your
  anger… which of these would you want to try out this week?
</p>

<ul class="about-list">
  <li>Remove yourself from the situation – e.g. go take a walk.</li>
  <li>Take slow deep breaths and concentrate on your chest.</li>
  <li>Concentrate on slowly counting up to 10.</li>
  <li>None of these.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p><em>When user selects any response except "None of these", chatbot answers...</em></p>
<br>

<p>
  Other than managing your anger in the moment, it can be helpful to take care of it on a daily
  basis. Here are some helpful techniques you can use… which would you be comfortable starting with?
</p>

<ul class="about-list">
  <li>Exercise regularly.</li>
  <li>Avoid using drugs or drinking too much alcohol.</li>
  <li>Keep a diary of how you feel when you’re angry.</li>
  <li>Try consistently getting 7–9 hours of sleep.</li>
  <li>None of the above.</li>
</ul>

            <h2 class="card-title">Key achievements</h2>
            <ul class="about-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Translated clinical research into accessible, empathetic guidance</strong>
                <br />
                Drew on <strong>evidence-based protocols</strong> (e.g., Deffenbacher &amp; McKay, 2000) and transformed complex
                psychological concepts (such as relaxation training, cognitive restructuring, and coping-skills development) into warm, user-friendly language suitable for a self-help audience.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Designed a conversation that mirrors a real CBT therapeutic flow</strong>
                <br />
                Structured the dialogue to naturally follow core CBT stages, ensuring both psychological accuracy
                and ease of engagement for users:
                <ol>
                  <li>Identifying triggers</li>
                  <li>Recognising early signs &amp; interrupting the cycle</li>
                  <li>Introducing longer-term lifestyle strategies</li>
                  <li>Using positive reinforcement</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Blended scientific accuracy with emotional warmth</strong><br>
    Created content that is clinically founded yet supportive and relatable, helping users feel guided rather than instructed, enhancing engagement with behaviour change strategies and overall app usage.
  </li>

          <h2 class="card-title">Additional achievements demonstrated in this conversation design</h2>
   <p>
  This conversation design shows my careful adaptation of messaging to the needs and background of users, in this case young adults.
  I intentionally used emojis, GIFs, and friendly, supportive language to mirror young adults' communication style, making the content feel more relatable and human.
  This ensured that the therapeutic guidance remained engaging and approachable without losing scientific accuracy.
