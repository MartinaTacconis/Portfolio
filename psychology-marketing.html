          How my UCL psychology training and my work at Heyr shape the way I think about campaigns, content,
          and growth.

        <p>
          Studying psychology at UCL trained me to look at behaviour before tactics. In marketing, that means
          asking <em>why</em> people do what they do before deciding which channel or format to use.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Heyr, I translate that into concrete decisions: how we frame value, what objections we address,
          and how we reduce friction in the journey from first contact to active member.
        </p>

        <h3>From theory to campaigns</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Cognitive biases:</strong> using concepts like loss aversion or social proof responsibly,
            to help users make confident choices rather than pressure them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Motivation &amp; habits:</strong> understanding what keeps people engaged over time, and
            how to design touchpoints that support long-term use instead of short spikes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Research mindset:</strong> treating campaigns as experiments, not just executions,
            and always looking for the next question the data suggests.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why this matters for marketing</h3>
        <p>
          A psychology + data-driven approach helps me create campaigns that feel human, not generic:
          matching messaging to real needs, choosing the right moment to talk to users, and measuring what
          actually changes behaviour instead of only chasing vanity metrics.
        </p>

        <p>
          The result is work that aims to be both effective for the business and respectful of the people
          on the other side of the screen.
