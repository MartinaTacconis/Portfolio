          <p class="card-meta"><strong>Context: Italian university students · Return from exam season </strong></p>
          <p><em>Translation of original Italian script</em></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            You’ve just wrapped up exam season and now it’s time to dive back into uni… but your budget’s feeling a
            little tight? Need to stock up on everything without draining your wallet?
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, have you ever tried cashback?
          </p>
          <p>
            Cashback is one of the easiest ways to save money when you shop online. Every time you buy something,
            a portion of what you’ve spent gets paid back to you. Simple.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are plenty of cashback sites out there, but TopCashback is completely free and incredibly easy
            to use, ideal for us students! And as the name suggests, it offers some of the highest cashback rates
            you’ll find anywhere. No wonder it’s a global leader with over 20 million members.
          </p>
          <p>
            And right now, until the 4th of March, there’s an unmissible offer bundle across all the stores
            you’ll probably need for the start of term or just to simply treat yourself, like Just Eat, Privè,
            Espresso, Unieuro and Libraccio with cashback rates going up to 50%!
          </p>
          <p>

            <ul class="about-list" style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 1.25rem;">
  <li>
    Framed the script around a <strong>real student moment</strong> (post-exam, low budget, needing to “restart” the semester) to create instant emotional relevance.
  </li>
  <li>
    Used a clear <strong>problem–solution structure:</strong> tight budget and essentials to buy → cashback as the easiest way to save.
  </li>
  <li>
    Combined <strong>education and simplicity</strong> by explaining cashback in one clear sentence.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added <strong>social proof and credibility</strong> (20M+ members, high cashback rates) to build trust quickly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Introduced <strong>urgency with a time-bound offer</strong> (“until the 4th of March”) to encourage immediate action.
  </li>
  <li>
    Made the benefits concrete by <strong>referencing relevant brands</strong> (Just Eat, Privè, Espresso, Unieuro, Libraccio) and a <strong>value anchor</strong> (“up to 50% cashback”).
  </li>
  <li>
    Closed with a <strong>dual call to action</strong>: click the link to start saving now + follow TopCashback Italy for ongoing deals.
